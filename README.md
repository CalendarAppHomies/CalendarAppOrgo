# Cultural Holiday Calendar


CulturalCalendar was designed for employers and managers of
companies to increase inclusivity and awareness of different cultures in the workplace.
It includes both well known holidays and holidays from under-represented cultures and religions.
In this way, we hope that workplaces can be more accepting and understanding throughout the year.
Our hack allows the user to select which groupings of holidays and celebrations to include in their own CulturalCalendar.
They can also search to see if any holidays occur on a given day. The user can then view a listing of all events they should be aware of in the year!
